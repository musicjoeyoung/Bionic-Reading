## What is "Bionic Reading"?

Bionic reading is an approach to reading that involves using technology to enhance and optimize the reading experience. This can include tools such as e-readers, digital note-taking apps, and online research databases to improve comprehension, retention, and analysis of information.

## Code Description

I wrote this because the bionic reading Chrome extensions that I tried were a bit finnicky. It's a lot easier for me to just save this code as a code snippet in dev tools and run it on pages when I need it. It makes the first half of each word bold making it easier, for some readers, to focus on the words.
